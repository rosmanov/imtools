# ImTools

Some tools to work with images using the OpenCV library.

Currently all tools except `immerge` are designed for testing; `immerge` is a tool to
detect modifications between two images and apply the changes to a number of
similar images (all images should have similar contents).

For instance, `immerge` can be useful to update a logo on a number of images.
